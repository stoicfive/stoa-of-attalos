# TDD Workflow Correction - Complete

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All Systems Aligned

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The portal and teacher READMEs incorrectly stated students should "Write tests" from scratch, but the actual codebase has test files with TODO(student) markers that students should complete.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **1. Portal Task Descriptions** ✅
**File:** `apps/student-portal/lib/session-tasks.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ A1S1: "Write Unit Tests" → "Complete Unit Tests"
- ✅ A1S1: "Add Component Tests" → "Complete Component Tests"
- ✅ A1S2: "Write Model Tests" → "Complete Model Tests"
- ✅ A1S3: "Write API Tests" → "Complete API Tests"

**Added:**
- Notes about TODO(student) markers
- Instructions to find and replace `pass` statements
- Example code showing TODO comments

### **2. Teacher README Files** ✅
**Files:** 
- `teacher/a1s1/README.md`
- `teacher/a1s2/README.md`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated step descriptions to say "Complete" instead of "Write"
- ✅ Added notes: "Test file already exists with TODO(student) markers"
- ✅ Added instructions: "Find test functions with `pass` statements"
- ✅ Added instructions: "Replace `pass` with actual test implementations"

### **3. Memory System** ✅
**Updated memory:** Trading Journal Learning System

**Now documents:**
- Tests already exist with TODO markers
- Students fill in test implementations
- Test structure guides what to test
- Proper TDD workflow

## 📋 Correct Student Workflow

### **Step-by-Step:**

1. **Read Session Overview**
   - Portal shows what to build
   - Teacher README explains objectives

2. **Implement Production Code**
   - Create Trade model/validators/components
   - Follow specifications

3. **Open Existing Test Files**
   - Tests already exist in codebase
   - Have TODO(student) markers

4. **Complete Test Implementations**
   - Find functions with `pass` statements
   - Read TODO comments and hints
   - Replace `pass` with actual test code

5. **Run Validation Scripts**
   - Execute `./scripts/check-{session}.sh`
   - Verify tests pass
   - Check coverage >= 70%

6. **Portal Shows Results**
   - Test results displayed
   - Grade calculated from rubric
   - Feedback provided

## 📝 Example Test Structure

### **What Students See:**

```python
def test_create_trade(db_session):
    """Test creating a trade instance"""
    # TODO(student): Create a trade and assert properties
    # Hint: trade = Trade(symbol="AAPL", entry_price=Decimal("150.00"), ...)
    # Hint: db_session.add(trade)
    # Hint: db_session.commit()
    # Hint: assert trade.id is not None
    # Hint: assert trade.symbol == "AAPL"
    pass  # Replace this with your implementation
```

### **What Students Do:**

```python
def test_create_trade(db_session):
    """Test creating a trade instance"""
    # TODO(student): Create a trade and assert properties
    # Hint: trade = Trade(symbol="AAPL", entry_price=Decimal("150.00"), ...)
    # Hint: db_session.add(trade)
    # Hint: db_session.commit()
    # Hint: assert trade.id is not None
    # Hint: assert trade.symbol == "AAPL"
    
    # Student implementation:
    trade = Trade(
        symbol="AAPL",
        entry_price=Decimal("150.00"),
        exit_price=Decimal("160.00"),
        shares=100,
        trade_date=datetime.now()
    )
    db_session.add(trade)
    db_session.commit()
    
    assert trade.id is not None
    assert trade.symbol == "AAPL"
    assert trade.entry_price == Decimal("150.00")
```

## 🎓 Why This Is Better TDD

### **Benefits:**

1. **Guided Learning**
   - Test structure shows what to test
   - Hints guide implementation
   - Students learn test patterns

2. **Consistent Quality**
   - Test function signatures standardized
   - Coverage requirements clear
   - Edge cases identified

3. **Faster Development**
   - No time wasted on test structure
   - Focus on implementation
   - Clear success criteria

4. **Better Feedback**
   - Validation scripts know what to check
   - Rubrics aligned with tests
   - Grades calculated automatically

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] Portal tasks say "Complete" not "Write"
- [x] Teacher READMEs say "Complete" not "Write"
- [x] Portal shows TODO marker examples
- [x] Teacher READMEs mention TODO markers
- [x] Memory system updated
- [x] All files committed
- [x] Build succeeds
- [x] Documentation consistent

---

## 📊 Files Changed

### **Portal:**
- `apps/student-portal/lib/session-tasks.ts` - Task descriptions updated

### **Teacher:**
- `teacher/a1s1/README.md` - Steps 3 and 5 updated
- `teacher/a1s2/README.md` - Step 5 updated

### **Documentation:**
- Memory system updated
- This correction document created

---

## 🎯 Impact

### **Before:**
- ❌ Confusion about creating vs completing tests
- ❌ Inconsistent messaging
- ❌ Students might create duplicate test files
- ❌ Unclear what to test

### **After:**
- ✅ Clear: complete existing test stubs
- ✅ Consistent across portal and teacher docs
- ✅ Students know exactly what to do
- ✅ Test structure guides implementation

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

Students can now:
1. View session in portal
2. Read teacher README
3. Implement production code
4. Complete test implementations
5. Run validation scripts
6. See results and grades

**Everything is aligned and ready for students!** ✅
