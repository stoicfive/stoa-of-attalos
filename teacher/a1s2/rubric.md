## Automatic Checks

The validation script (`./scripts/check-a1s2.sh`) verifies:
- ‚úÖ All required files exist
- ‚úÖ Database connection works
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ 70%+ test coverage
- ‚úÖ Migrations apply successfully
- ‚úÖ No linting errors

**Passing all automatic checks = minimum 70 points**

---
