# Implementation Planning Notes

**This folder is gitignored** - Use it for personal planning and notes.

## Purpose

Store implementation plans, brainstorming, and work-in-progress documentation that shouldn't be committed to the repository.

## Suggested Structure

```
docs/notes/
├── implementation-plans/     # Session implementation plans
│   ├── a1s2-plan.md
│   ├── a1s3-plan.md
│   └── ...
├── brainstorming/            # Ideas and rough drafts
├── progress/                 # Personal progress tracking
└── scratch/                  # Temporary notes
```

## What Goes Here

- ✅ Implementation plans before they're finalized
- ✅ Personal TODO lists
- ✅ Brainstorming sessions
- ✅ Work-in-progress documentation
- ✅ Meeting notes
- ✅ Scratch work

## What Doesn't Go Here

- ❌ Finalized documentation (goes in `docs/`)
- ❌ Student-facing materials (goes in `teacher/`)
- ❌ Code (goes in `apps/` or `packages/`)

## Note

All files in this folder are automatically ignored by Git. Feel free to organize however you like!
