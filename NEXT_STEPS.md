# 🚀 Next Steps - Getting Started

## ✅ What's Complete

Your full-stack learning environment is **100% ready**! Here's what you have:

- ✅ Dev Container with Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI with 8 parallel checks
- ✅ ESLint rules enforcing 300-line files, 50-line functions
- ✅ Playwright E2E testing configured
- ✅ Test coverage thresholds (70/25/5 pyramid)
- ✅ Complete sample teacher pack (A1S1)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 📋 Immediate Actions

### 1. Install Dependencies (Required)

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- Playwright browsers
- All Node.js dependencies
- @types/node for TypeScript

### 2. Test the Dev Container (Recommended)

```bash
# In VS Code:
# 1. Install Docker Desktop
# 2. Install "Dev Containers" extension
# 3. Cmd+Shift+P → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
# 4. Wait for setup (~2-3 minutes first time)
# 5. You're ready!
```

### 3. Verify Everything Works

```bash
# After npm install, run:
npm run check:all
```

**Expected**: Some checks will fail because the starter files (`packages/types/`) are incomplete - that's intentional! They're for students to complete.

## 🎓 Try the Sample Teacher Pack (A1S1)

### Read the Session Guide

```bash
# Open in your editor:
teacher/a1s1/README.md
```

This is a complete 50-minute learning session on building a trading journal entry form.

### Explore the Structure

```
teacher/a1s1/
├── README.md              # Full session guide
├── hints.md               # 3-tier progressive hints
├── rubric.md              # 100-point grading rubric
└── solutions/             # Reference implementations

packages/types/src/
├── trade.ts               # TODO: Define Trade interface
├── validators.ts          # TODO: Implement validation
└── __tests__/
    └── validators.test.ts # TODO: Write tests

scripts/
└── check-a1s1.sh         # Run all checks for this session
```

### Run the Session Check Script

```bash
chmod +x scripts/check-a1s1.sh
./scripts/check-a1s1.sh
```

This will show you what a student would see when validating their work.

## 📚 Key Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `README.md` | Project overview & quick start |
| `FULL_STACK_SETUP.md` | Complete technical documentation |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` | What was built & why |
| `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` | Daily command reference |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution guidelines |
| `SETUP_SUMMARY.md` | Original setup details |

## 🎯 Creating More Teacher Packs

Use A1S1 as a template:

### 1. Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p teacher/a1s2
mkdir -p teacher/a1s2/solutions
```

### 2. Copy Template Files

```bash
cp teacher/a1s1/README.md teacher/a1s2/
cp teacher/a1s1/hints.md teacher/a1s2/
cp teacher/a1s1/rubric.md teacher/a1s2/
```

### 3. Customize for Your Session

- Update objectives
- Modify steps
- Adjust timebox
- Change language focus (TS → Python → SQL rotation)
- Create new starter files with TODO comments
- Write reference solutions

### 4. Create Check Script

```bash
cp scripts/check-a1s1.sh scripts/check-a1s2.sh
# Update session name in the script
```

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Start Development

```bash
# Watch mode for tests
npm run test:watch

# Watch mode for E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Run Checks

```bash
# Individual checks
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run format:check

# All checks
npm run check:all

# Session-specific
./scripts/check-a1s1.sh
```

### Python Development

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
poetry install

# Run Python tests
poetry run pytest

# Lint Python code
poetry run ruff check .

# Format Python code
poetry run ruff format .

# Type check Python
poetry run mypy .
```

### Database

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL (if not using Dev Container)
docker-compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d db

# Connect to database
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/trading_journal

# Stop database
docker-compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml down
```

## 🎓 Learning Workflow

### For Students

1. **Read the session README** (`teacher/a1s1/README.md`)
2. **Take the recall quiz** (60-90 seconds)
3. **Start Sprint 1** (25 minutes)
   - Implement TODOs in starter files
   - Run tests in watch mode
   - Use Tier 1 hints if stuck
4. **Break** (5 minutes)
5. **Start Sprint 2** (25 minutes)
   - Complete remaining TODOs
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Run check script
6. **Submit PR** with "What I Learned" (3-5 bullets)

### For Teachers

1. **Review PR** against rubric
2. **Check CI status** (all checks must pass)
3. **Provide feedback** using rubric template
4. **Suggest improvements** (1 refactor + 1 stretch test)
5. **Approve or request changes**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module '@playwright/test'"

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### "Type errors in starter files"

This is expected! The starter files are incomplete (TODOs for students). They're excluded from type checking in `tsconfig.json`.

### "Tests failing"

The example tests pass, but any tests in `packages/types/` will fail until students implement the TODOs.

### "Dev Container won't start"

```bash
# Rebuild without cache
Cmd+Shift+P → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container Without Cache"

# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Check logs
docker-compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml logs
```

### "Python dependencies not installing"

```bash
# Install Poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

Your environment is working correctly when:

- ✅ `npm install` completes without errors
- ✅ `npm run lint` passes (except starter files)
- ✅ `npm run typecheck` passes (starter files excluded)
- ✅ `npm test` shows 8 passing tests (example tests)
- ✅ `npm run format:check` passes
- ✅ Dev Container opens successfully
- ✅ PostgreSQL connects on port 5432

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Everything is set up and ready to go. You can now:

1. **Start learning** with A1S1
2. **Create new sessions** using the template
3. **Customize** the environment for your needs
4. **Scale** to support the entire course

**The foundation is solid. Time to build!** 🚀
