## Slide 4: The Session Format ⏱️

**Every session follows this pattern:**

1. **Pre-Quiz** (60-90 sec) - What do you remember?
2. **Sprint 1** (25 min) - Build with TDD
3. **Break** (5 min) - Stretch, hydrate, reflect
4. **Sprint 2** (25 min) - Finish and verify
5. **Submit** - Run checks, write "What I Learned"

**Total: 50 minutes of focused learning**
