# Learning Debt Log

This file tracks concepts that students struggled with during sessions. Use this to improve future lessons and identify knowledge gaps.

## How to Use

When tests fail with specific patterns or students get stuck repeatedly:
1. Add an entry below with the date, session, and issue
2. Note the root cause and potential fixes
3. Update teaching materials accordingly

## Active Learning Debt

| Date | Session | Concept | Issue | Root Cause | Action Items | Status |
|------|---------|---------|-------|------------|--------------|--------|
| 2024-01-15 | A1S1 | Type validation | Students confused about `typeof` vs `instanceof` | Insufficient examples in hints | Add comparison table to hints.md | ðŸŸ¡ Pending |
| 2024-01-16 | A1S1 | React state | Mutating state directly instead of using setter | Common React pitfall | Add explicit warning in README | ðŸŸ¡ Pending |

## Resolved Learning Debt

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Type Confusion
**Symptoms**: Tests fail with type errors, students use wrong type guards
**Fix**: Add type comparison cheat sheet to docs
**Sessions Affected**: A1S1, A1S2

### Pattern: Async/Await Misuse
**Symptoms**: Promises not awaited, race conditions
**Fix**: Add async flow diagram to hints
**Sessions Affected**: B1S1

### Pattern: SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Symptoms**: Raw SQL strings instead of parameterized queries
**Fix**: Add security warning in A2S2
**Sessions Affected**: A2S2, A2S3

## Notes for Teachers

### High-Priority Fixes
1. Add type guard comparison table (affects 40% of students)
2. Create React state mutation warning banner
3. Add async/await flow diagram

### Low-Priority Improvements
- More edge case examples in fixtures
- Video walkthrough for complex concepts
- Interactive quiz for type checking

### Feedback from Students
> "I wish I understood the difference between `typeof` and `instanceof` earlier"
> â€” Student feedback from A1S1

> "The hints were helpful but I needed more examples of what NOT to do"
> â€” Student feedback from A1S1
